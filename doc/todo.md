# Getting a super short POC
* Get the api POC setup:
    * An api that shortens a url
        * Returns a key
        * doesn't actually save anything

    * An api that lengthens a key, and causes a redirect
        * Returns a default url

* Take a Break:
    * think about what's left

# Getting a working POC
* Setting up persistance:
    * Get a database set up - use azure
    * Use it
* Integrate into the database

# Getting a deployable POC
* Get the connection string from an environment variable - Make a note of this somewhere
* Have a script that sets things up
* Delete the project
* Repull it
* How hard is it to setup from scratch

# Test + Refactor
* Get an E2E project setup
* Get some basic E2E tests
    * Happy path
    * Bad url
    * Bad Key

* Appearances:
    * Get the { almond } braces on the go.
    * Check any names ( Capitals for class methods, lower case of variables );

# Clean up and finish
